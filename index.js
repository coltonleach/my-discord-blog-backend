      `Howdy, welcome to my Discord themed website! My name's Colton, and I created this site to learn ReactJS, and boy was it a trip. Everything here is made from scratch, the only thing I took from Discord (other than the inspiration) is the color palette. If you'd like to see my progress updates, click the blog ‚Äúserver‚Äù on the left hand side, and you'll see all my entries since the start of this project.`,
      `If you'd like to contact me for any reason, my email is <a class="hypertext" href="mailto:leach.colton@hotmail.com">leach.colton@hotmail.com</a>. And if you would like to see any of my other projects (I recently created a weather app and am now working on a React Native app), here's my <a class="hypertext" href="https://github.com/coltonleach/">GitHub</a>, and here's my <a class="hypertext" href="https://codepen.io/issvor/">Codepen</a>.<span class="edited"></span>`,
      `A bit about me: I'm entirely self taught in web development, photoshop, video editing, and photography. I've been building computers since my teens, and playing video games since I was 4 years old. Back in 2006, I grew a soft spot for videography because of YouTube, and I would take my mom's little point and shoot camera everywhere to record everything I did. Because of YouTube, I stumbled upon a community of 3D artists that used a combination of Photoshop, After Effects, and Cinema 4D, which resulted in me learning those programs to make YouTube backgrounds for my channel and for some friends. After I graduated high school, my mom gave me a hand-me-down Nikon DSLR, and I loved that little thing. Nearly everyday I'd walk around town taking pictures of whatever I thought was neat, and that eventually evolved into me getting brand new gear and doing a few photoshoots for family and friends. This was at the same time I truly started my software development journey.`,
      `I started learning how to program when I was 12 years old, but never did anything more than learn how to use loops. Around 2014-15, I took a web development class in high school, but the teacher didn't actually teach us anything related to HTML. I took it upon myself to learn a little bit and I started hosting a little website for my friends and I. A few years later in college I took a Java class that didn't teach me anything more than how to use loops. I transferred to a different college and the next programming class I had to take was data structures and algorithms, so I had a <b>lot</b> of catching up to do. Those were my only two programming classes, and I wasn't really enjoying C++. In March of 2021, a friend of mine showed me some stuff he did in React Native, and I was instantly hooked. I found some stuff from freeCodeCamp, wasn't really getting it, then stumbled upon Bob Ziroll's Scrimba course and dove head first in the deep end. After completing his course, I realized that my foundation was minuscule and would lead to problems down the road, so I decided to start from scratch. I focused primarily on HTML and CSS, watching a lot of Kevin Powell videos. I made a few small websites, then started learning how to design some stuff using Javascript and manipulating the DOM. After getting comfortable enough with that, I came back to React, and this was the first project I attempted.<span class="edited"></span>`,

I have a function where when you click a channel, it updates a local state in the channels component and stores which channel is active. I have a useEffect hook that is supposed to set state back to its initial values so that the first channel is always selected whenever you select a server.<code><pre>
useEffect(() => {
  setActiveChannel({
    ...activeChannel,
    activeObject: activeChannel.objects[index],

      Well for some reason state wouldn't get initialized back to its default values, causing all sorts of problems with selecting a channel. After hours of staring at my screen and dozens of console logs, I finally realized it's because I set the wrong value in the useEffect hook. Instead of setting it back to the default values, I was using the previously stored values in state, and simply reassigning state to the previous values. Here's what it should be: <code><pre>
useEffect(() => {
  setActiveChannel({
    ...activeChannel,

      `I've been making some awesome progress on my React Native app, but I'm still not ready to announce it just yet. I will give you some details on it though. It's a serverless fullstack app using either Firebase or Supabase as the backend (still haven't decided yet). In thoery, it's almost like a watered down social media app, in the sense that it will allow users to create profiles and potentially have a friends list. But that's all I'll say for now.`,
      `About three weeks ago I finished designing the frontend and putting it together (that was annoying to learn, given the fact that it's not real CSS), so I moved on to getting the functionality to work and quickly came across a problem. I don't know how to do use authentication at all, or even where to begin. So that is where my research began. After I took a brief break from the project, of course.`,
      `Two weeks ago I started doing research on what I should do for the backend, and remembered that Firebase has user authentication, and tons of options. Then that reminded me of another service a friend of mine told me about, Supabase. It's an open source alternative to Firebase and basically has everything Firebase has.`,
      `A few days after I started reading through the documentation and quickly realized that I'm not really understanding what I'm looking at (turns out I was looking at the wrong spot altogether), so I kept doing some research on other options out there. Because of the wrong impression I got from Supabase (entirely my fault), I decided to learn Firebase in the mean time on a sandbox project in the mean time, then consider using Supabase on the React Native app. While I was researching, I spent the next week designing and building the frontend. Once that was done, I put on my thinking cap and took an actual shot at learning Firebase.`,
      `I found a good video on integrating email/password user auth with Firebase and React, and went to town. It was an hour long, decided to take it slow to hopefully obsorb as much information as possible, so I did the first half one day and the second half the next. I quickly got the user auth working, and then tried figuring out how to store user data alongside it.`,
      `It took me way longer than I'm willing to admit to figure out how to store user data in Firestore, using the uid from Firebase's auth service, but I did it. My main problem was that almost every resource I came across that had examples and walk throughs would put every bit of code within a single file, but the setup I had involved two seperate files: firebaseConfig.js that stores all the Firebase information and exports the auth and db, and then AuthContext.js that has all the backend functions like 'signin', 'signout', 'createNewUser', etc., and I really like that setup and vowed to figure out how to keep it that way.`,
      `Turns out I was over thinking it and once it clicked in my head, I got the ball rolling in no time. I got the Firestore stuff working in about 4 hours, and now my sandbox app is almost complete. The only things left to do is properly sit down and learn the useContext hook so I don't have to do some funky state/prop management and then I'll be all set to work on the React Native app again.`,

Four days ago I said screw it, I'm going to make one from scratch and actually work through it.`,

On the second day, and a fresh pair of eyes, I ended up with a break through and really liked what I came up with. I spent the rest of the day finishing up the design, got about 90% of the way there then took a break for the day.`,
      `Yesterday is when I started the markup and styling, and I managed to finish the page the same day. I feel like I came up with some creative solutions to a few things, noteably the circle with a cutout of me in it. I just used an ::after pseudo element to put me in front of the circle with overflow set to hidden, but the cool part was setting it's width and height to the viewport width to make it semi-responsive without having to use breakpoints.`,
      `Overall, I'm incredibly happy with the current result. I'm thinking of adding some fun SVG backgrounds to some of the sections, but I'm gonna learn from my past mistakes and pace myself, as it's not a priority.`,

I've ran into a problem that isn't necessarily difficult to fix, it's just that I don't understand <i>how</i> it works specifically. So right now I'm tied between continuing on with FullStackOpen, or give NextJS a shot.`,

I've seen a lot of stuff about NextJS lately and have a growing interest in trying it out, but I feel that FSO will ultimately be the more secure route to go down.

      `Second project is a chat app that utilizes Firebase as the backend. It works rather well, but has a few minor bugs. I learned a ton from this project, and one of the biggest things I got from it was a boost in confidence when it comes to reading the documentation and trusting that I actually know what I'm doing. Typically I'd look for multiple resources about a feature before trying to implement it myself, but this time I would only look at the dedicated documentation and try it myself, then look up additional resources if I couldn't figure it out myself. This was a game changer.`,
      `Third project is a tool to extract the edits made to a photo exported from Adobe Lightroom, and display all the settings to the user. I want to also show a "before" image of what the photo probably looked like without the settings applied, but that's an entirely different beast to tackle. I decided to take up TypeScript for it, and <b>man</b> is TypeScript frustrating to learn. I know it will only benefit me, but there are so many nuances to keep track of, it gets kind of overwhelming. But with that being said, it has been nice and I'm excited to get efficent at it and make some even better projects with it.`,
      `Lastly, I met someone that's looking for a free-lance type of web developer (simple side work), and I told him I can do it. I sent him my website and he sounded interested. To convince him that I'm capable of the job, I decided to recreate his Wordpress homepage from scratch with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS in four hours. I streamed the whole thing and sent him the VOD and final product and he was thrilled. We talked about it more and he's really excited about the opportunity, even more-so than I am üòÖ. You can check out the <a class="hypertext" href="https://youtu.be/MWCdqyBU9u4" target="_blank">VOD here</a>, or the <a class="hypertext" href="https://coltonleach.github.io/overse-clone/" target="_blank">final product</a>.`,
      `As for now, I want to create one more mock website with some cool stuff I've learned, then focus on my previous projects. Also, since Heroku is removing their free tier, I'm shopping around for some other options and have currently landed on Cyclic for the backend of this blog. It looks pretty extensive, so I'm sure it will all work out üòÄ`,

      `In my last article, I mentioned that I wanted to create an additional mock website and utilize some of the cool stuff I've learned. Instead of a mock website, I decided to make a new portfolio site üòÖ. I love my current one for a <i>lite</i> design, but I got something brewing and it's looking awesome so far.`,
      `I finished the intro/hero section and part of the 'my work' section (which took a good while to figure out), but now I'm taking a small break to polish up my chat app. I'll start posting blogs whenever I get back to working on the portfolio app, because I have already learned a few additional tricks that would be great to document, so I'm sure I'll find some more stuff to ramble about.`,
      `As for this chat app, back when I finished the main functionality, I took a break from it to focus on some other stuff and I originally thought that the list of stuff I needed to work on was going to be difficult, but so far I'm chopping the list down steadily. I started working on it this morning around 8am, and it's 11:23am now and I've already fixed 5 things on my list. Granted, they were the easiest ones, but hey, the little wins count too.`,
      `Also, setting up Cyclic for the backend of this blog was incredibly simple. I just created an account, setup a repo on Github for my backend, linked it to Cyclic and I was done. Definitely recommend it!`,

      `With the chat app, I ran into a tiny, yet huge security vulnerability. Whenever a user selects a chat, logs out, then logs into a different account, that previous chat log is still there. I'm speculating that it's because one of the components isn't unmounting properly, because the return on the useEffect doesn't seem to be executing. So for now, I'm going to take a break from the chat app while I do some research while working on a different project.`,
      `I decided to pick up my Kanban/notes app I had going back in July, and man it's always funny looking at an old project you haven't touched in a while. It's like a completely different language, and it took me a little bit of time to remember what all is going on. Kind of makes me wonder if this is parallel to getting on a new dev team and having to learn their codebase.`,
      `Anyway, right now it's using plain React, but I'm thinking of taking this opportunity to learn Next.JS. So far I've refactored the styles, a bit of the components, and organized the file structure a bit better. I also added a json-server for testing purposes, as I plan on using MongoDB Atlas for the database. I do want to learn to setup an SQL database because of Prisma (I know that Prisma works for Mongo, but from the little research I've done, it seems like SQL just makes more sense with Prisma), but maybe instead of that I could use Supabase since this needs user auth anyway.`,
      `I'm not sure what direction I want to go down, though, as I don't want to flood myself with too much <i>new</i> tech to mitigate "scope creep". With all that being said, no matter what direction I head, it will definitely be worth it as I think it would be great for me to learn any of the previously listed tech. For now, I'm going to prioritize making the primary functionality work and then figure what direction to head.`,

      `I like the progress that I have made in 2022, but I feel like it could've been better if I structured out what I want to learn and focused on the end goal. I just kind of went with the flow and did whatever I found interesting, (which there's nothing wrong with that approach!) and I managed to learn a good bit.`,
      `A list of things that come to mind that I've learned is: some React Native, the foundation of SASS, some exposure to Firebase, some advanced React topics, a bit of understanding of the backend, and general overall improvements with my frontend skills.`,
      `A common theme here is I learned primarily surface level knowledge of each topic. Not only was it primarily surface level knowledge, but I hopped from one tech to the next pretty frequently instead of sticking something out. 2023 will be different, starting now. Here I'll explain either what tech I'd like to learn or a project I'd like to do, along with a "why" and "how" in order of highest to lowest priority.`,
      `More familiarity with React hooks such as useRef, useContext, useEffect, and custom hooks. Obviously this is an important key aspect of React, and will only further strengthen my foundation. I have used each of these before, but my understanding is quite limited, and my main priority amongst these is useContext and useEffect. useContext is a requirement for a proper user authentication experience. I listed useEffect specifically because I want to get a better understanding of a components lifecycle, specifically unmounting. I plan on simply studying each of these hooks while using them in my applications.`,
      `TypeScript: I've been reading and watching videos related to using TS and it has definitely peaked my interest. I love that it essentially forces you to have better practices, and that the eslint will basically tell you exactly what object, variable, or whatever needs before you even try to use it. Definitely seems like a great addition, and will only make me a better, more diverse developer. I have a project already setup for TypeScript, so I'm simply going to work on that with some small stuff in between.`,
      `Next.JS: So far everything I've seen regarding Next has been positive, and the features it offers seem incredible for a bigger application (notably static paths and SSR for SEO). Right now I'm not quite sure what project I would like to do, but we'll burn that bridge when we cross it.`,
      `Prisma: I was watching Theo recently and he mentioned that he's not worried if he has to change his backend service provider because he uses Prisma, and he can simply "re-route Prisma to point at a different SQL database and not worry about anything else." Not sure how accurate that is, or if I completely understand what he means, but I have seen other stuff related to Prisma and it looks interesting enough to be worth the investment. Fireship's 100s video on it and it definitely looks worth it.`,
      `GraphQL: I haven't written a GraphQL API before, nor have I worked with one. This is definitely a worthy investment as it's growing in popularity, and I'm sure I'll come across them more often in the wild.`,
      `I think a fun thing to do to test myself a year from now is to try and make an application that uses all of this. The hardest part is to come up with a project üòâ`,

      `I decided to finish up my newest portfolio design that I started working on back in November. I think it turned out great, and I like that it's got some fun creative aspects while being decently simple and to the point.`,
      `Last week, a friend of mine came to me with a project idea that I really took to. He's focusing on the backend while I focus on the frontend. I came up with a decent little design and went to work. It gave me my first glimpse into refactoring an existing application, and boy it was something.`,
      `The framework we're using is Vue, which I have literally no experience in. I was genuinely taken back by how much effort goes into just learning the codebase and trying to understand the flow of it all. The organization, file structure, and pretty much everything went against what I know and love, so it's definitely gonna take some time to adjust.`,

      `Well we're almost half way through 2023, and I accidentally went against the grain of my resolutions for the year. Let me explain.`,
      `A friend told me he wanted to make his own video sharing platform for him and our friends. He told me some feature ideas he had and I really liked it. The next day he had a working app that did exactly what he wanted. When he showed it to me, I roasted him about the frontend and he said "Hey man, I'm a backend dev. If you want the frontend, take it." I was stoked, since I've only ever worked on personal projects, so I was totally down.`,
      `The techstack is Nuxt3, Supabase, Backblaze, and Cloudflare. Thankfully I only needed to work the frontend, so I let him handle all the scary stuff. My first two weeks were frustrating and humbling. I've never worked in Nuxt, let alone Vue, so I had a lot of learning to do before I could make any meaningful progress. The experience was frustrating because I was having such a hard time adapting to Vue3 and Nuxt3 coming solely from React. Humbling because I always thought "If you know one framework, you know them all." Boy was I wrong. With that being said, it was still great and turned out well. Vue/Nuxt has some querks that I'm not fond of, but overall wasn't that bad of an experience.`,
      `After a month I completely revamped the frontend and worked on some small features to enhance the UX. I'm still incredibly proud of it. What's funny is the part that was the toughest was coming up with a name for the service. We landed on the name <a class="hypertext" href="https://reruns.io">Reruns</a>. The experience of developing this app was incredible, and I learned a TON while working on it. I also ran into a bug that seemingly no one else has either noticed or attempted to fix with Firefox's default HTML5 player. If you play a video and enable the "loop" option, the first playthrough is fine. On the following plays, if you mute the video, it behaves as if you paused the audio track. So if you mute the video for 2 seconds and unmute it, the audio is delayed by 2 seconds. From my testing, this isn't a problem in Chromium browsers. Not only that, if you have a custom context menu (on right click of the video) in Firefox with the default controls enabled, you cannot close the context menu whenever you click on the video. The only way to achieve it, is if you put an mouseclick event listener on the body of the page and close the context menu. So because of those two problems, I created my own custom controls.`,
      `Anyway, we have some awesome features in mind for Reruns, but the project is currently on the back burner for the time being. Because of working with Nuxt3, I decided it was about time I actually dived into Next - which apparently was perfect timing with the release of Next13. I haven't done a whole lot with it right now, but I'm working on two projects right now. One of them is actually a reboot of a previous project of mine, called Park It! It was intended to be a mobile app, but I ran into so many problems with React Native/Expo due to ignorance and bad practices. It's still an incredible idea, and a few days ago I realized I could just make it a web app and take a mobile first approach.`,
