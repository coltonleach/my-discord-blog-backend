      `Howdy, welcome to my Discord themed website! My name‚Äôs Colton, and I created this site to learn ReactJS, and boy was it a trip. Everything here is made from scratch, the only thing I took from Discord (other than the inspiration) is the color palette. If you‚Äôd like to see my progress updates, click the blog ‚Äúserver‚Äù on the left hand side, and you‚Äôll see all my entries since the start of this project.`,

      "A bit about me: I‚Äôm entirely self taught in web development, photoshop, video editing, and photography. I‚Äôve been building computers since my teens, and playing video games since I was 4 years old. Back in 2006, I grew a soft spot for videography because of YouTube, and I would take my mom‚Äôs little point and shoot camera everywhere to record everything I did. Because of YouTube, I stumbled upon a community of 3D artists that used a combination of Photoshop, After Effects, and Cinema 4D, which resulted in me learning those programs to make YouTube backgrounds for my channel and for some friends. After I graduated high school, my mom gave me a hand-me-down Nikon DSLR, and I loved that little thing. Nearly everyday I‚Äôd walk around town taking pictures of whatever I thought was neat, and that eventually evolved into me getting brand new gear and doing a few photoshoots for family and friends. This was at the same time I truly started my software development journey.",
      "I started learning how to program when I was 12 years old, but never did anything more than learn how to use loops, then in college I took a Java class that didn‚Äôt teach me anything more than how to use loops. I transferred to a different college and the next programming class I had to take was data structures and algorithms, so I had a <b>lot</b> of catching up to do. Those were my only two programming classes, and I wasn‚Äôt really enjoying C++, so I decided to check out the web development side of things. A friend of mine showed me some stuff he did in React Native, and I was instantly hooked. I found some stuff from freeCodeCamp, wasn‚Äôt really getting it, then stumbled upon Bob Ziroll‚Äôs Scrimba course and dove head first in the deep end. After completing his course, I realized that my foundation was minuscule and would lead to problems down the road, so I decided to start from scratch. I focused primarily on HTML and CSS, watching a lot of Kevin Powell videos. I made a few small websites, then started learning how to design some stuff using Javascript and manipulating the DOM. After getting comfortable enough with that, I came back to React, and this was the first project I attempted.",

      "As for setting up the functionality, I'm not exactly sure where to start, but I think it's going to involve a few things I'm not familiar with. First part being React Router. I've messed with it once just to see how your supposed to set it up, but haven't gotten to know it or understand it. I'm sure it won't be too difficult, though.",
      "Second part is state. I've messed with state, made the typical increment/decrement project, fumbled around with a todo list, but I'm definitely not sure how I will be incorporating it with this project.",
      "Now that I think about it, I will probably need nested routes since I'm going to have that chat window be dependent on the channels, and the channels dependent on the servers. Hopefully that isn't too much of an issue."

But I always want something to be displayed no matter what.",
      "I think instead of having nest routes and having to deal with state management for routes, I'll find a way to have the channels component communicate with its sibling, the chat window. I don't know if it's possible or not, but there has to be a way.",
      "After a bit of googling, it seems like there isn't technically a way for siblings to communicate, but there's a trick called 'raising the state' where you take a component's local state, bring it up to the closest parent, and then pass down state to both, you can manipulate state from a child component that affects their sibling."

      "The reason I think this is the perfect project for a newbie like me is because it's putting myself in a situation where I need to use a bunch of different features at once, and finding a way to make them all work together. The little projects I worked on before were things like 'make this number inside state increase/decrease', or 'use conditional rendering to show a p tag or an h1 tag', but this project has me working with multiple states, passing props all over the place, using React Router, and trying out the useEffect hook in React.",

      `I have the blogs stored in state, and whenever I load the website, the blogs get filtered to their respective location and get passed down through props. So far so good. I have a function where when you click a channel, it updates a local state in the channels component and stores which channel is active. I have a useEffect hook that is supposed to set state back to its initial values so that the first channel is always selected whenever you select a server.<code><pre>
useEffect(() => {
setActiveChannel({
  ...activeChannel,
  activeObject: activeChannel.objects[index],
  objects: articles,
})
}, [articles])</pre></code>
      Well for some reason state wouldn't get initialized back to its default values, causing all sorts of problems with selecting a channel. After hours of staring at my screen and dozens of console logs, I finally realized it's because I set the wrong value in the useEffect hook. Instead of setting it back to the default values, I was using the previously stored values in state, and simply reassigning state to the previous values. Here's what it should be: <code><pre>
useEffect(() => {
setActiveChannel({
  ...activeChannel,
  activeObject: articles[0],
  objects: articles,
})
}, [articles])</pre></code><span class="edited"></span>`,
